# Audio Renaming and Conversion Tool

The Audio Renaming and Conversion Tool automatically renames and converts all of the audio files in Epic Mickey, giving them more descriptive filenames and making them playable in VLC. It uses the game's internal filenames for renaming and vgmstream and ww2ogg for file conversion. To use the program, simply extract the zip file and follow the instructions in *[_README.html](readme.html)*. The [extracted Epic Mickey game files](./modifying-game-files) are required.
