			<h1>Renaming and Conversion Tool for Epic Mickey</h1>
			<p>
				Please read the following before using the program:
			</p>
			
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Renaming and Conversion Tool for Epic Mickey (this program)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm" target="_blank">Ravioli Game Tools</a> (version 2.10 or newer)</li>
					<li>Epic Mickey extracted game files (<a href="https://epicmickeymodding.fandom.com/wiki/Modifying_Game_Files" target="_blank">how?</a>)</li>
					<li>A computer with Windows 7 or newer</li>
					<li>~4GB of free space for audio files</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The amount of time that the process will take to run will depend on your computer's speed and available resources. It may take up to 10 minutes.</li>
					<li><strong>Your CPU usage will spike while the process is running</strong>, possibly causing your PC to become slower until it is complete. I recommend grabbing a snack or finding something else to do while the program is working.</li>
					<li>Some files cannot be renamed due to there being no name in <i>SoundbanksInfo.xml</i>. These files are placed in <i>__Converted\Unnamed\</i>. This is not a bug.</li>
					<li>If the program closes unexpectedly or you encounter an error, check <i>__Converted\log.txt</i>.</li>
					<li>Check <i>__Converted\skipped_files.txt</i> after the process is complete to make sure the program didn't have to skip any files.</li>
					<li>Please report any errors to me through one of the <a href="https://andrew.plus" target="_blank">contact links on my site</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<h3>Setting up files</h3>
					<li>Create a <span class="wf">working folder</span> somewhere on your PC.</li>
					<li>Navigate to your Epic Mickey extracted game files and go to <i>Audio\Wii\</i>. Select all of the files in the folder (ctrl+a) and copy them to the clipboard. Then, paste them into your <span class="wf">working folder</span>.</li>
					<li>Close the Epic Mickey game files and go back to your <span class="wf">working folder</span>. You should see a <i>Localize</i> folder. This contains different language-specific audio files. Copy any of the files you would like to process into the root of your <span class="wf">working folder</span>. Files in <i>Localize</i> <strong>will not be processed</strong> unless they are moved to the root.</li>
					
					<h3>Ravioli Game Tools</h3>
					<li>Navigate to wherever you installed Ravioli Game Tools and run <i>RExtractor.exe</i>.</li>
					<li>Click the <i>Browse...</i> button next to <i>Input file(s)</i> and locate your <span class="wf">working folder</span>. Select <strong>all</strong> of the bnk files in this folder and click <i>Open</i>.</li>
					<li>Now click the <i>Browse...</i> button next to <i>Output directory</i> and set it to your <span class="wf">working folder</span>.</li>
					<li>Click the <i>Start</i> button. Once it is complete, you may close Ravioli Game Tools.</li>
					
					<h3>Running the Renaming and Conversion Tool</h3>
					<li>Unzip the <i>Renaming and Conversion Tool</i> into your <span class="wf">working folder</span>. (EMAudioProcess.zip)</li>
					<li>Go to your <span class="wf">working folder</span> and run <i>_AudioProcess.exe</i>. Type "start" in the window that pops up.</li>
					<li>The program will now rename and process all of the wav, wem, and ogg files in your <span class="wf">working folder</span>. Once it is complete, the files can be found in the <i>__Completed</i> folder.</li>
