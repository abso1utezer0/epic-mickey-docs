# Cutscene Files

Cutscenes in Epic Mickey are stored in the BIK file format. They can be found in the Movies directory of the game and can be easily opened, viewed, and converted using [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). All cutscenes lack subtitles and some are missing certain music and/or sounds that are present in the game.

## Playing cutscenes in widescreen

There are two versions for most cutscenes: one for standard definition (in the StdDef folder) and one for widescreen (at the root of Movies). Keep in mind that the widescreen versions need to be "stretched" to be viewed in actual widescreen. This can be done in VLC by clicking 'Video' in the top menu bar and changing the aspect ratio to 16:9.
